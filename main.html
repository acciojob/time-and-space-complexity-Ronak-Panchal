        <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
        The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function
        of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the
        actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.
        <br>
        <b>Definition–</b>
        The valid algorithm takes a finite amount of time for execution. The time required by the algorithm to solve
        given problem is called time complexity of the algorithm. Time complexity is very useful measure in
        algorithm analysis.
        It is the time needed for the completion of an algorithm. To estimate the time complexity, we need to
        consider the cost of each fundamental instruction and the number of times the instruction is executed.

        <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
        <b>Definition –</b>

        Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in
        execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of
        the algorithm.

        The space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of space taken by an algorithm to run as a function
        of the length of the input. Consider an example: Suppose a problem to find the frequency of array elements.

        It is the amount of memory needed for the completion of an algorithm.
        <br>
        To estimate the memory requirement we need to focus on two parts:
        <br>
        (1) A fixed part: It is independent of the input size. It includes memory for instructions (code), constants,
        variables, etc.
        <br>
        (2) A variable part: It is dependent on the input size. It includes memory for recursion stack, referenced
        variables, etc.
